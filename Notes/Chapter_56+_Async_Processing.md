# Async Processing

- For this tutorial, we will be using a in-dev third party library called Asyncq, which is backed by Redis. `https://github.com/hibiken/asynq`
- To run a redis server on our local machine, we will use a docker image, which we can search on `hub.docker.com` and use the official redis image from there.
